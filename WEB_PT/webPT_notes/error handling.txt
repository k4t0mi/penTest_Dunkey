1.
Analysis of Error Codes 
These codes are very useful to penetration testers during their activities because they reveal a lot of information about:
 databases, bugs, and other technological components directly linked with web applications. 
Test 404 Not Found
Test 400 Bad Request
Test 405 Method not Allowed 
Test 408 Request Time out 
Test 501 Method Not Implemented 

2.
 Analysis of Stack Traces 
Stack traces are not vulnerabilities by themselves, but they often reveal information that is interesting to an attacker.
 This information could then be used in further attacks. 
How to Test :
Some tests to try include: 
? Invalid input (such as input that is not consistent with application logic)
 ? Input that contains non alphanumeric characters or query syntax
 ? Empty inputs ? Input that are too long
 ? Access to internal pages without authentication
 ? Bypassing application flow
