1. Test Business Logic Data Validation 
How to Test 
? Review the project documentation and use exploratory testing looking for data entry points or hand off points between system or software.
 ? Once found try to insert logically invalid data into the application/system 
? Perform front-end GUI functional valid testing on the application to ensure that the only “valid” values are accepted
 ? Using an intercept proxy observe the HTTP-POST/GET looking for places that variables such as cost an quality are passed.
 ? Verify that input HTTP  request and every HTTP response contains a content type header specifying a safe character set (e.g., UTF-8).
 ? Verify that HTTP headers in both requests and responses contain only printable ASCII characters
 ? Verify that the input field have “max-length” 
? All Input Validation test cases 
 ? Testing for Account Enumeration and Guessable User  Account 
 ? Testing for Bypassing Session Management Schema
 ? Testing for Exposed Session Variables

2. Test Integrity Checks
How to Test 
? Using a proxy capture and HTTP traffic looking for hidden fields /  non editable
 ? If a hidden field is found see how these fields compare with the GUI application and start interrogating this value through the proxy by submitting different data values trying to circumvent the business and manipulate values you were not intended to have access to.
 ? List components of the application or system that could be edited, for example logs or databases
 ? For each component identified, try to read, edit or remove its information 

3.Test Upload of Unexpected File Types :
*Basic file upload 
*Double Extension Injection Technique
*Content Type file Upload 
*Null byte Injection :
1.gif file & php reverse shell file in the same folder
2.apt-get install gifsicle
3.root@kali> gifsicle –comment “`tr ‘\n’ ‘ ‘ < simple-backdoor.php`” < hehe.gif >action_back_out.php
4.Now we have to change the file name hehe.gif to hehe.phpA.gif.
 After changing the file name, click on hex. Now we can see all the Hex code.
 Scroll down the tab and find the name, which we have changed in the previous steps.
Now, add the null character in the position of A: 00
*Blacklisting File Extensions : for example change php to php3 may work
