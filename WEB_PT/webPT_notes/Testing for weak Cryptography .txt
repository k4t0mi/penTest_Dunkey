1. SSL/TLS Testing :

witn nmap -sV , is able to identify SSL services

Identifying SSL services and weak ciphers with Nessus.

Identifying weak cipher with:
 https://www.ssllabs.com/projects/index.html 

Manually audit weak SSL cipher levels with:
 openSSL:
SSLv2 	'openssl s_client -ssl2 -connect host:port' --->If connects? insecure! 	OpenSSL <1.0.0
'openssl s_client -no_tls1 -no_ssl3 -connect host:port'
openssl s_client -tls1_1 -connect host:port (if connects its a secure result)
openssl s_client -tls1_2 -connect host:port  (if connect its a secure result)

**White box testing: Check the configuration of the web servers which provide https services.:
The registry path in windows defines the ciphers available to the server: 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SC HANNEL\Ciphers\ 

****Testing SSL Certificate Validity – Client and Server :
Check the CA (Certificate Authority) is trusted
Check the certificate is currently valid - Certificate have an associated period of validity
Using Browser such as FireFox : try to connect to the site via https connections and see if the browser alerts :
'your connection is not secur' & others

*******Using MMC in window to view list of trusted CA

2. Testing for Padding Oracle :

 The existence of a padding oracle allows an attacker to decrypt encrypted data and encrypt arbitrary data without knowledge of the key used for these cryptographic operations.

nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 -Pn <host name>
