Testing for default credentials:

1.
Application administrative users are often named after the application or organization.
 It mean if you are testing an application named “ABC”, trying abc/abc or any other similar combination as username and password.
 
2.
Check for configuration files that contain usernames and passwords

3.Testing for Weak password policy:

1. What characters are permitted and forbidden for use within a password?
 Is the user required to use characters from different character sets such as lower and uppercase letters, digits and special symbols?
  ? 2. How often can a user change their password? How quickly can a user change their password after a previous change? Users may bypass password history requirements by changing their password 5 times in a row so that after the last password change they have configured their initial password  again. 
 ? 3. When must a user change their password? After 90 days? After account lockout due to excessive log on attempts? 
 ? 4. How often can a user reuse a password? Does  the application maintain a history of the user's previous used 8 passwords?
  ? 5. How different must the next password be from the last password? 
 ? 6. Is the  user prevented from using his username or other account information (such as first or last name) in the password?
